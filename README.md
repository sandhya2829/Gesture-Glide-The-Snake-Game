# Gesture-Glide-The-Snake-Game
new repo

This project is a fun and interactive hand-controlled Snake Game built using Python and Computer Vision (OpenCV). Itâ€™s a great addition to your portfolio or resume, showcasing your ability to integrate real-time camera input, hand gesture detection, and game logic using libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, and cvzone. To run the game, simply open snakegame.py in any Python IDE such as VS Code, PyCharm, or Spyder, install the required libraries (opencv-python, cvzone, and numpy), and start the program. Once the game launches, your webcam will activate, and your  fingers will control the movement of the snake. The goal is to collect as much food as possible while avoiding collision with your own tail. If you do touch the tail, the game ends with a "Game Over" screen. You can easily restart the game anytime by pressing the "X" key on your keyboard. This project is a simple yet impressive way to demonstrate your Python and computer vision skills in action.
